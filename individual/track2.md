## Track 2: Implementing a Retention Recommendation

## Recommendation Implementation

We recommend a **targeted retention program for new, lightly engaged customers**, identified through data as having early tenure with low add-on adoption. The goal is to improve engagement and lock-in value during the critical first 90 days.  

## **Key actions include:**  
- Free technical support for the first 60 days  
- Guided onboarding emails highlighting product features  
- Trial nudges for add-on services to encourage adoption

## Success Metric and Baseline
- **Success metric:** Increase in add-on adoption rate and reduction in churn for this segment within the first 90 days.  
- **Baseline churn/add-on adoption:** Early-tenure churn rate ~27%, low add-on adoption rate ~15%.  
- **Metric not to worsen:** Overall customer satisfaction and revenue per customer should not decrease due to these interventions.

## Measuring Impact and Risks
- **Measurement:** Conduct an A/B test where new, lightly engaged customers are randomly assigned to receive the retention program or serve as a control. Compare engagement, adoption, and churn after 60–90 days.  
- **Risks / Unintended Consequences:**  
  1. Overloading new customers with communications, leading to disengagement.  
  2. Cost of incentives (tech support, add-on trials) may outweigh short-term retention if adoption doesn’t materialize.
