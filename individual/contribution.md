## Personal Contributions

During the case competition, I contributed most heavily to **preprocessing, RandomForest model development, and the final business recommendations**. I also took the lead on creating the **PowerPoint presentation** to communicate our analysis and insights in a clear and compelling way.

## Specifically:  

- **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:** I cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and engineered relevant features based on patterns discovered during exploratory data analysis (EDA). These preprocessing decisions directly influenced the model's performance and ensured our predictions were robust.  
- **RandomForest Modeling:** I implemented and tuned the RandomForest model, selecting hyperparameters such as `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `max_features` through cross-validation to balance bias and variance. I ensured the model was evaluated using appropriate metrics (ROC-AUC) to measure classification performance on unseen data.  
- **Recommendations:** I translated our analysis into actionable business recommendations, ensuring they were specific, feasible, and supported by the data. These recommendations were designed to address operational and customer impact while considering trade-offs and constraints.  
- **Presentation:** I developed the PowerPoint slides, highlighting key findings and model insights, and crafted visualizations that clearly communicated the results to a non-technical audience.

## Decisions or Approaches Advocated

I personally advocated for **careful preprocessing and feature selection prior to modeling**, emphasizing that clean, meaningful features would improve model reliability and interpretability. I also pushed for **using RandomForest** over simpler models because it could handle complex interactions in the data while maintaining stability and robustness but XGBoost won.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Effective Communication is Critical:** Translating technical insights into a story that a non-technical audience can understand is as important as the analysis itself.  
2. **Collaboration & Delegation:** Sharing tasks based on team strengths and having regular check-ins ensured our project stayed on track and high-quality.

With additional time, I would test alternative models and simulate different retention interventions to quantify the potential impact of strategies like loyalty programs, personalized offers, or proactive support initiatives.
